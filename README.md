# Work-Scheduler

## Description
When you open the page for the scheduler, you will see a list of times going from 9 am to 5 pm. You can save text in the text area beside the time by inputing text and pressing the save button. After it saves you can close the page and open it again, and it will still be saved. When you press the save button, some text will appear above the schedule confirming that you saved the appointment set at that time.
